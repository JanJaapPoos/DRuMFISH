WP3 conducting a brief review of how data-poor stocks have been included so far in bioeconomic mixed-fisheries models, thus extending the section 6 of the WP2 review. The papers reviewed were those addressing data-poor stocks from a simulation point of view (typically, ex-ante evaluation of the potential performance of future management strategies in mixed-fisheries), not from an assessment point of view (parameter fitting).

A number of options were found in the literature. For stochastic models running in the medium / long-term, the classical option is to simulate data-poor stocks using a standard biomass dynamic (surplus production) model (Schaefer, Fox or Pella-Tomlinson), or its bioeconomic equivalent (Cobb-Douglas function). Alternatively, some models have “forced” data-poor stocks into a standard age-based simulation model using various assumptions on growth and stock-recruitment relationships, sometimes borrowing information from other stocks closely related (e.g. Garcia et al., 2013, Woods et al., 2015).

The second option does not proceed with any assumption on the relationship between fishing and the data-poor stock’s biomass, but assumes at contrary a constant catch rate (constant CPUE). In such case, a maximum catch threshold can be defined, which represents a proxy for a limit reference point. Scenarios where effort would increase above the Cmax/CPUE would be considered as unsustainable. This option has for example been used for non-fish bycatches where the stock dynamics cannot be predicted from fisheries only, such as Australian sea snakes (Gourguet et al., 2015a), New Zealand sea lions (Kahui, 2012). The option of constant CPUE can also be used for short-term forecast when it can be assumed that the biomass next year would not be significantly different from the one this year. The ICES MWGMIXFISH uses this approach to estimate the impact of the mixed-fisheries scenarios on bycatch species such as turbot, hake or red mullet; and such an assumption forms also the basis of the ICES advice for Nephrops stocks. Pushing this further, ICES (2015b) investigated the robustness of alternative options to predict catches one year ahead, including constant CPUE, constant catchability or an Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) time-series approach that detrends annual and seasonal CPUE signals. For the case investigated (Celtic Sea), all methods performed reasonably well, able to forecast catch to ±20% at the stock level in most cases, but forecasts were more accurate using the most recent year (both for catchability of CPUE approaches). 

Finally, a few simulation studies have linked the harvesting of bycatch species to that of the target species in a slightly less conventional way. For example in the Mediterranean MEFISTO model the yield of bycatch (secondary) species includes a linear relationship with the yield of target species (Merino et al, 2015). 

The impact of the choice of simulation algorithm for the data-poor stocks has not been really evaluated, but it can be consequent since models involving a Scheafer biomass dynamic function will likely be more conservative with regards to depletion risks than models involving constant CPUE or Fox models. Some of the simulation tools used in DRuMFISH (such as FLBEIA, IAM or FCube) are rather flexible and can accommodate several possibilities, so it might be possible to conduct such sensitivity analyses on a few selected cases. Options for this will be investigated in the second half of the project. 

Additionally, it is clear that the needs to decide upon data-poor algorithms in mixed-fisheries simulation models decrease when actual stock assessments improve. In the recent period, major initiatives are being developed outside the remit of DRuMFISH to improve the quality of the stock assessment for data-poor stocks, both in the ICES area and in the Mediterranean Sea. Quantitative models such as SPiCT are progressively being fitted and implemented for a vast amount of new stocks, together with corresponding reference points and short-term forecast. As such, simulation testing of harvest strategies can now be based on these agreed stock assessments instead of having to fit them from scratch. This means that the focus of WP3 is shifting from its initial purpose of testing the sensitivity of mixed-fisheries management strategies to the choice of the data-poor stock assessment model. Rather, WP3 is moving towards developing the current mixed-fisheries simulation tools such as FLBEIA, FCube, IAM into including these new types of assessment, in order to provide an extended frame for e.g. the evaluation of the current mixed-fisheries management plans. 

During the Barcelona workshop in September 2016, options for these were discussed. It was recognised that single-stock harvest strategies for data-poor stocks would suffer from a number of issues, including 1) harvest strategies cannot be implemented independently for each stock; 2) the management of bycatch affects target fisheries; 3) efficient management actions for bycatches are not always straightforward; and 4) the linkages between target species and bycatches in terms of catchability/fishing mortality are not necessarily linear. A possible approach was suggested, including the following steps:
1)	Identify where the relationships between target and bycatch are significant at different scales (in time, space and metier aggregation)
2)	Identify through Ecological Risk Assessment which bycatch species are potentially more vulnerable and may be given more focus
3)	Define Target and/or Limit reference points, or eventually trigger reference points
4)	Use these in mixed-fisheries short-term forecast to identify the risks of hitting the bycatch limit reference point next year when managing key species
5)	Use these models to identify “how much avoidance” would be needed to reduce  these risks and discuss possible mitigation measures
6)	Investigate options for mixed-fisheries Harvest Control Rules

This approach could be implemented and tested in the various case studies in WP4. In order to achieve this, progresses are needed for the various models involved in the project, in order for them to include a greater variety of Data-Poor assessment and forecast models. Progresses for the different models is briefly summarised below: 

FCube:  Fcube is a mixed fisheries model that has been used as Management Strategy Evaluation tool for data rich stocks in the North Sea (Ulrich et al., 2017).  At present, the FCube model involved only DLS stocks of category 1, while Nephrops evaluated with UnderWater TV were also accounted for in short term forecasts CPUEs. Within D DrumFish, progresses are now ongoing to incorporate SPiCT assessment and forecast procedures into the FCube model, both for short-term deterministic and medium-term stochastic projections.  

IAM: The IAM model is mainly developed for the Bay of Biscay, which triggered need to account for SS3 assessment results. Until now, catches of the main driving species other than hake and sole were included through a function of the effort assuming constant CPUE. Following WP2 recommendations, development of the simulation framework of IAM in the Drumfish project concerns the inclusion of alternative population models. The model is being developed to be able to include population dynamics based on SPICT assessment parameters available for anglerfish and sea bass which are two main commercial species driving the strategies in the VIIIabde.  According to the Nephrops benchmark, Nephrops stock dynamics will also be considered in the simulation framework based on short term forecast from TV-survey assessment or empirical approaches.  According to stock category and available models and assessment parameters, IAM proposes 4 kinds of population dynamics, two for category 1 stocks, 1 for category 3 stocks with a SPICT assessment and 1 for other stocks.

FLBEIA: The FLBEIA modelling framework is being applied to several case studies. FLBEIA already allows for including age- and biomass -dynamic stocks within the simulation framework. However, most of data-limited stocks lack the necessary data to parameterise such models, hence, it is necessary to find ways to incorporate these stocks into the simulation framework. A possible approach previously used is to parameterise biomass dynamic model, where the intrinsic growth parameter ‘r’ could be conditioned conducting a meta-analysis of this parameter in stocks with similar characteristics. Then a scenario based approach could be used to condition the ratio between current biomass and carrying capacity. These two assumptions will be enough to reconstruct the time series of biomass using a biomass dynamic model. 

Additionally, One of the potentials of FLBEIA is that it incorporates the possibility of including the whole management process, including data collection and assessment model, within the simulation framework.  At present only XSA model is ready to be used as assessment model. In DRumFish the models proposed to assess the stocks in Bay of Biscay case study will be incorporated within FLBEIA. For the moment SPiCT is being incorporated. 

FLBEIA is also being applied to the demersal mixed fishery of the North Sea, building on the same data as FCube. Within the context of DRUMFISH, focus will be given on the incorporation of the SPiCT assessment model in the FLBEIA Biomass Dynamics Population Growth function (data poor stocks), which also uses a Pella and Tomlinson surplus production model (Pella and Tomlinson 1969). Comparison will be made between the different formulations of short- and medium-term forecasts. FLBEIA includes already a number of features for management scenarios, which can be used and tested for Data-Poor stocks. 

Finally, an FLBEIA application is also being developed for the Adriatic Case study taking in account seven species, combining the outcomes of the data poor assessments with the analytical assessments carried out in the framework of both GFCM-SAC and STECF. 
Ultimately, progresses in WP3 are being achieved on identifying possible options of mixed-fisheries Harvest Control Rules (point 6 above). They aim at finding some best combinations of target F per stock within the established boundaries of Fmsy ranges. At present, no mixed-fisheries objectives exist for that, and therefore the options already existing are explorations of the range of possibilities. For example, for each of the three models referred above, a form for HCR has been explored: 

•	In FCube, an optimisation algorithm  has been developed to find the combination of target F that would minimise the risk of mixed-fisheries conflicts by minimising the differences between “min” and “max” options (Ulrich et al., 2016);
•	In IAM, a unique solution is searched following the principle of the co-viability approach where “harms” are minimised both for stocks or fleets (Gourguet et al., 2013). 
•	In FLBEIA, a mixed-fisheries HCR maximising yield within MSY constraints has been developed – see explanation in Appendix E1. The objective of the HCR is that it produces consistent TAC advice and makes an efficient use of the fishing opportunities of all the stocks. 
These are only three illustrations of how MSY ranges could be used in a smart way by using additional objectives. 
These aspects will be developed further during 2017, through their implementation and exploration in the various cases studies in WP4.
